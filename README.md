# rtk-joyo-comparer
RTK Joyo comparer is a website that visualizes how much of the Joyo kanji you know from James Heisig's book "Remembering the Kanji".
Maybe this is useless, but I thought it was a nice way to visualize your progress (even though it doesn't matter because Heisig's method, and how far you've come in the book, already tells us how much joyo kanji you know (by taking RTK index divided by 2136))
